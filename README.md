# 💰 Expense Tracker

A simple console-based expense tracking application built using Node.js.
Users can record their daily expenses, view all entries, and calculate the total amount — all directly in the terminal.

This project was created as part of my JavaScript learning challenge and exercise

It’s a great beginner-friendly project to strengthen your skills in building interactive console applications with Node.js.
